Example files for Bluetooth Solution
====================================
To be used in conjunction with course EB639.
However it is prefered that both lecturers and students create their own code whereever pratical.

IMPORTANT:
Bluetooth relies heavily on uinque addresses for Bluetooth devices.
The example files were created using the addresses ofthe test equipment 
here at Matrix Multimedia.

Before using porgrams that require Bluetooth adresses (which is most of them)
the addresses will need to be changed for those of the devicesthat the student or class will be using.

Note that changes will need to be made for each device used as they have unique addresses.

The Bluetooth address can be found on a label under the EB024 Bluetooth board, and under the BLU2i module board.

Should the BLU2i board need to be separated from the EB024 board for any reason, ensure that all board and BLU2i numbers match when replacing the boards so that the right module is used with the right board.
