HOW TO BURN ARDUINO UNO BOOTLOADER TO ATMEGA328P

Requirements:
2-Arduino Uno Boards
1-ATMEGA3228P IC (without bootloader burned in)
6-Male to Male Jumper Wires


Arduino1- Will act as ISP Programmer
Arduino2- Will act as a burning hardware for the ATMEGA328P

Connections:

Arduino1	=========>	Arduino2

GND		=========>	GND
5V		=========>	5V
Pin10		=========>	Reset
Pin11		=========>	Pin11
Pin12		=========>	Pin12
Pin13		=========>	Pin13

STEPS:

1. Connect Arduino1 to PC
2. Load the Arduino ISP code from the example codes
3. Upload the code to Arduino1
4. Goto tools>Programmer and set it to "Arduino as ISP"
5. Goto tools>Burn Bootloader
6. Wait until done.
